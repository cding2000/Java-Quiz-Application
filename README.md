# Python-Quiz-Application



Hey, everyone. My name is Chuqi Ding. I created this simple python quiz mobile application, which count how many question you miss, whether you pass the test or not, allow you to retake the quiz after you finish quiz. Hopefully, this application is good for people who are unfamiliar with the language and can use it to get better understand of the python basic knowledge.
