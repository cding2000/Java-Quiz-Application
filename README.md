# Python Quiz Application

Hello, everyone! I'm Chuqi Ding, and I've created a simple Python quiz mobile application. The app counts the number of questions you miss, evaluates whether you pass the test, and allows you to retake the quiz. It's designed to help those who are unfamiliar with Python to improve their basic knowledge.

## Software Demo Video

Check out the application in action by watching this [Software Demo Video](https://youtu.be/5zD2PpTTj3E).

## Development Environment

I developed this Python quiz mobile application using Java. Java is a widely used object-oriented programming language and software platform that runs on billions of devices, including notebook computers, mobile devices, gaming consoles, medical devices, and more.

## Useful Websites

Here are some useful websites that I referred to during the development:

* [4 Ways to Implement OnClickListener on Android](https://medium.com/@CodyEngel/4-ways-to-implement-onclicklistener-on-android-9b956cbd2928)
* [YouTube Tutorial: Creating a Quiz App in Java](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Cbk2vK0FLU)
* [YouTube Tutorial: How to Make a Quiz App in Android Studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZvjSl9dswg)

## Future Work

I plan to enhance the Python Quiz Application with the following features in the future:

* Add a feature that only allows users to retake the quiz if they fail.
* Implement the ability to save the questions that users missed and allow them to review them later.
* Integrate the application with a Python question database for auto-generated quizzes.

Feel free to contribute or provide feedback to make this Python Quiz Application even more valuable!
